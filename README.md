## Main Features
* Users have the ability to search for assets by name and order assets by name and price.
* Users can purchase NFTs by linking their MetaMask wallet, with MetaMask serving as the platform for processing the transactions.
*   Users have the ability to view the name, hash, and [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) URL of items they've purchased on the website.
*  The data is stored in a database for quicker retrieval, and all purchases are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
